*Variable Selection with FDR Control for Noisy Data â€“ An Application to Screening Metabolites that Are Associated with Breast and Colorectal Cancer.* _arXiv preprint_, arXiv:2310.06696.

This work proposes a novel FDR-controlling method for variable selection in noisy, high-dimensional datasets. The methodology is applied to metabolomics data to identify cancer-related metabolites associated with breast and colorectal cancer, demonstrating robust power and precision under noisy conditions. The findings provide practical tools for biomarker discovery in clinical research.
