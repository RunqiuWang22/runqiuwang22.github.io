This paper presents a novel statistical method for variable selection under high-dimensional noisy settings with control of the false discovery rate (FDR). The proposed method is applied to metabolomics data to identify biomarkers associated with breast and colorectal cancer, demonstrating strong power and robustness in noisy environments.
