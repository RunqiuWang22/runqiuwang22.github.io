This paper introduces the application of the Normalized Iterative Hard Thresholding (NIHT) algorithm in the context of high-dimensional logistic regression. Through simulation and application to metagenomics datasets, the method demonstrates strong performance in both variable selection and interpretability compared to other penalization techniques such as Lasso and SCAD.
