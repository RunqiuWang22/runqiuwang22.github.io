**Wang R., Huang D., Weng Y., & Zhao X.** (2024). *Missing Data in Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) Studies*. Poster presented at OB Science Day, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Silver Spring, MD.

This poster presents a comparative evaluation of statistical methodsâ€”including Multiple Imputation (MI), Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW), and Augmented IPW (AIPW)â€”for handling missing data in ABPM studies under different missingness mechanisms (MCAR and MAR). Simulation results and practical recommendations for study design are discussed.
