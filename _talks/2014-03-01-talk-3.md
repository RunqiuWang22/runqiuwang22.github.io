**Wang R., & Wu C. O.** (2018). *Identifying Risk Factors Associated with Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Cardiovascular Death Using Machine Learning Techniques based on BARI 2D Data.* Student Poster Presentation at **Georgetown University**, December 12, 2018.

This poster explores the application of machine learning algorithms to identify key predictors of major cardiovascular events using data from the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D) study. Techniques such as classification trees, random forests, and gradient boosting were used to assess variable importance and improve predictive modeling of cardiovascular outcomes.
