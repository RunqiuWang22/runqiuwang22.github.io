**Wang R., Dai R., Dai H., & Zheng C.** (2024). *Controlling FDR in selecting group-level simultaneous signals from multiple data sources with application to the National COVID Collaborative Cohort data.* Oral-Contributed Talk at the **Eastern North American Region (ENAR) Spring Meeting 2024**, Baltimore, MD.

This talk presents a knockoff-based algorithm designed to control the false discovery rate (FDR) in group-level variable selection from multiple data sources. The method ensures exact FDR control under finite sample settings and was applied to the National COVID Collaborative Cohort (N3C) to identify replicable signals in electronic health records across multiple sites.
