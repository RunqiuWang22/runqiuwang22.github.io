**Wang R., Dai R., Huang Y., Neuhouser M., Lampe J., Raftery D., Tabung F., & Zheng C.** (2023). *Variable selection with FDR control for noisy data â€“ an application to screening metabolites that are associated with breast and colorectal cancer.* Top-Contributed Paper Presentation at the **Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) 2024**, Portland, OR.

This talk introduces a novel statistical method for variable selection under high-dimensional noisy settings with false discovery rate (FDR) control. The method was applied to identify cancer-related metabolites from large-scale metabolomics datasets. The results demonstrate strong empirical power and robustness, offering practical utility in biomarker screening studies.
