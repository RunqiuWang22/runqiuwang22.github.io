Welcome to my website!  
Iâ€™m Runqiu (Rachel) Wang, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), and **currently on the job market** seeking full-time opportunities starting in **summer 2025**. I am open to roles as a **biostatistician or data scientist in industry**, as well as **postdoctoral or research scientist positions in academia**.

My research and professional experience sit at the intersection of statistical innovation and biomedical application. I specialize in **multiple testing**, **machine learning**, and **causal inference**, with recent contributions focused on **controlling the false discovery rate (FDR)** in **causal nonlinear models** and **multi-center variable selection**. My doctoral work has been applied in large-scale collaborative projects such as the **National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C)** and the **Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)**.

With over two years of industry experience in clinical trials and drug developmentâ€”including work at the **U.S. FDA** and **Firma Clinical Research**â€”Iâ€™ve contributed to **SAP development**, **CRF review**, and **FDA submission support**. Iâ€™m proficient in **R, SAS, Python, and SQL**, and I bring experience working with **CDISC datasets (SDTM/ADaM)**, **TFLs**, and **Define.xml**.

I enjoy translating complex data into meaningful insights, whether Iâ€™m applying machine learning to real-world data or conducting simulation studies for regulatory science. Iâ€™m particularly drawn to roles where I can combine methodological research with practical problem-solving to improve healthcare outcomes.

If you're hiring or collaborating in these areas, Iâ€™d love to connect!
