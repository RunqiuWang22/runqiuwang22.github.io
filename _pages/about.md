Welcome to my website!  
I’m Runqiu (Rachel) Wang, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), and **currently on the job market** seeking full-time opportunities as a **biostatistician/data scientist** starting in **summer 2025**.

My research and professional experience sit at the intersection of statistical innovation and biomedical application. I specialize in high-dimensional data analysis, multiple testing, Bayesian methods, and causal inference, with recent contributions focused on controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in nonlinear models and group-level variable selection. My doctoral work has been applied in large-scale collaborative projects such as the National COVID Collaborative Cohort (N3C) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

With over two years of industry experience in clinical trials and drug development—including work at the U.S. FDA and Firma Clinical Research—I’ve contributed to SAP development, CRF review, and FDA submission support. I’m proficient in R, SAS, Python, and SQL, and bring experience working with CDISC datasets (SDTM/ADaM), TFLs, and Define.xml.

Whether it’s applying machine learning to omics data or leading simulation studies for regulatory science, I enjoy translating complex data into meaningful insights. I'm particularly drawn to roles where I can combine methodological research with practical problem-solving to improve healthcare outcomes.

If you're hiring or collaborating in these areas, I’d love to connect!
