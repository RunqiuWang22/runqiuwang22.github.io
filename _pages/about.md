Welcome to my website!  
I’m Runqiu (Rachel) Wang, a Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), passionate about applying statistical innovation to real-world biomedical challenges. With over two years of industry experience in clinical trials and drug development, I bring a strong foundation in both statistical theory and practical implementation.

My research lies at the intersection of high-dimensional inference, multiple testing, and Bayesian methods, with recent work focusing on developing novel approaches for false discovery rate (FDR) control in nonlinear and group-level models. I also have hands-on experience with causal mediation analysis, simulation studies, and machine learning applications in clinical and omics data.

In the industry, I’ve contributed to Phase II/III clinical trials, FDA submission support, and the creation of CDISC-compliant datasets, TFLs, and define.xml files. During my time at Firma Clinical Research and the FDA, I led analyses for studies in nephrology, ophthalmology, and cardiovascular health.

I’m also actively involved in collaborative research projects, including the National COVID Collaborative Cohort (N3C) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). My toolkit includes R, SAS, Python, and SQL, and I enjoy bridging the gap between statistical rigor and impactful scientific discovery.

I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities as a biostatistician or data scientist, where I can contribute to innovative research and data-driven decision making in healthcare and beyond.
